# VBA-Challenge


**Backround**



This VBA Challenge provides data from stocks that highlight their anual performance from years 2014-2016.
Source of Data pulled from https://github.com/RutgersCodingBootcamp/RUT-SOM-VIRT-DATA-PT-03-2021-U-C/tree/master/02-Homework/02-VBA-Scripting/Instructions/Resources
Each stock Ticker contains multiple prices of when the stock opened and closed throughout time for each year mentioned above.
Data includes Ticker, Date, High, low, volume, close, and volume.
The script can be found from the folllowing link https://github.com/Andyjag91/VBA-Challenge/blob/main/VBA%20Script:%20Stock_Analysis_Over_Time
Once ran, the script will create a summary table that groups the stocks by their ticker symbols. Within each ticker will highlight their yearly change, percent change, and total stock volume.
Conditional formatting was used to show either a positive or negative change in prices.
Positive change in prices betwwen their closing and opening time was highlighted in green, compared to negative change highlighted in red. 
Some stocks opened with a price of 0, therefore percent change could not be calculated. Instead these stocks were labeled as new stocks, since they opened but without a price
